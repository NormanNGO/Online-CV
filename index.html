    <h3>Little Story</h3>
    <p>I am a high scored graduated student in IT, my strong skills are in coding, and programing. During my study, I have passed through different kind of jobs, that bring me an opportunity to deeply understand what is lacking in some of the industries such as Contruction & Restaurant
      where having extremly less investment in IT and remains a lot of barriers.Therefore, my first business named NT's Mowing and Cleaning Services, now can be known as NT's Mowing and Landscaping Services will soon become a Tech-Garden business where you can have your booking online,
      payment online, request the quote online, customer interaction & loyalty reward, etc. Website called www.NaturalTasmania.com.au is our prototype added up and running on host server since July 2020.   </p>
    <p>The term "Tech-Garden" is quite new to the industry, thanks to Jim's Mowing group, they are a Motivation and a Tremendous Mirror 'Model' for me to get this idea.YES nothing is here yet to show you except some of the simpliest toys as you can see at the moment on the website but NO worry we must ride to there.  </p>
